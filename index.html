      <p cl>Hello world, my name is Scott Brenden. I a Seattle based human male. I am western Washington born and raised, and as a result I love spending time in the outdoors(Skiing, boarding, climbing, Mt Biking, ect). Eventhough I have never lived outside of a small area I enjoy visiting new places. I Have been all over North America and have also visited a few places in Eourpe and South America. Without adventure life would be dull indeed.</p>
